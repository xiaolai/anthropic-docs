  Deep reference for the Managed Agents product — Anthropic-hosted
  long-running agents (Dreams) with their own environments, sessions,
  files, memory, vaults, tools, MCP connectors, multi-agent
  coordination, webhooks, GitHub integration, permission policies,
  and event streaming. Covers onboarding through to production
  deployment with cloud containers.

# Platform — Managed Agents

> *Router lives in [`SKILL.md`](SKILL.md). For the Agent SDK
> (build your own agents locally with TS/Python), see
> [`claude-agent-sdk`](../claude-agent-sdk/SKILL.md). Managed Agents
> is the *hosted* alternative — Anthropic runs the agent infrastructure.*

## Key facts (at intent time)

- **Managed Agents vs Agent SDK:** the SDK is a library you embed in
  your app (you run the loop). Managed Agents is a hosted product
  (Anthropic runs the loop, your agent definition lives on Anthropic
  infrastructure). Decision: SDK for tight integration with your
  service; Managed Agents for fire-and-forget jobs and the Dreams
  long-running pattern.
- **Also available on Claude Platform on AWS.** Managed Agents runs on
  AWS-hosted Claude infrastructure with some differences in feature
  availability and session behavior. See
  [`claude-platform-on-aws.md`](https://platform.claude.com/docs/en/build-with-claude/claude-platform-on-aws.md).
- **Endpoint rate limits (org-level):** Create endpoints (agents,
  sessions, environments, etc.) — 300 RPM. Read endpoints (retrieve,
  list, stream, etc.) — 600 RPM. Org-level spend limits and tier-based
  rate limits also apply.
- **Dreams = long-running.** A Dream is an agent execution that can
  run for hours or days, surviving across sessions. Use for research
  syntheses, batch processing, multi-step workflows that don't fit
  in a single conversation.
- **Sessions are persistent conversations.** Unlike Messages API
  (stateless), a Managed Agent session holds state across calls.
  Bill by tokens consumed, not by session duration.
- **Vaults** store secrets your agent needs to access third-party
  services (API keys, OAuth tokens). Encrypted at rest, scoped per
  agent, never exposed to your agent's prompt context.
- **Permission policies** gate what each agent may do (which tools,
  which file paths, which network endpoints). Set on the agent
  definition; enforced server-side. Default-deny.
- **Cloud containers** are the execution sandbox for code-running
  agents. Limited CPU / memory / network egress. Configure per agent
  via the environments resource.
- **Beta API surface.** All Managed-Agents endpoints currently live
  under `/v1/...` with the `anthropic-beta` header
  (`managed-agents-2026-04-01`). Pin the beta string to a specific
  version; the shape may evolve.
- **Memory stores persist cross-session.** A memory store
  (`memstore_...` ID) is a workspace-scoped collection of text
  documents mounted as a directory in the agent's container. Create
  via `POST /v1/memory_stores`, seed with
  `POST /v1/memory_stores/{id}/memories`, attach when starting a
  session. Every write creates an immutable version (audit trail).
  Requires the agent toolset to be enabled for read/write operations.
- **Webhooks for async results.** Long-running Dreams notify
  completion via webhook (configure per agent). Don't poll — the
  webhook is cheaper and faster.

## Self-hosted sandboxes

Keep tool execution inside your own infrastructure while Anthropic continues
to run the orchestration control plane. Not available on Claude Platform on AWS.

**When to self-host:**
- Data cannot leave your network boundary.
- Agent needs to reach internal services not publicly routable.
- Compliance or audit controls require execution in your environment.

**vs. cloud containers:**

| | Cloud containers | Self-hosted sandbox |
|---|---|---|
| Where tools run | Anthropic-managed | Your infrastructure |
| Network reach | Anthropic's egress controls | Your network policy |
| File / repo mounting | Managed by Anthropic | Managed by you |
| Lifecycle | Managed by Anthropic | Managed by you |

**Combine with MCP Tunnels:** Self-hosting controls *where the agent's code
executes*; MCP tunnels controls *how Anthropic reaches MCP servers in your
network*. They are independent and complementary.

**Setup:**

Create an environment with `config: {"type": "self_hosted"}` via
`POST /v1/environments` (beta header `managed-agents-2026-04-01`). Generate
an **environment key** (`ANTHROPIC_ENVIRONMENT_KEY`, prefix `sk-ant-oat01-`)
in the Console — scoped to one environment's work queue, not to your whole
organization.

**Sandbox filesystem:**

| Path | Purpose |
|---|---|
| `/workspace` | Default workdir; skills downloaded to `/workspace/skills/<name>/` |
| `/mnt/session/outputs` | Agent writes final output files here; mount a host volume to retrieve them |

**Worker patterns:**

| Pattern | Tool | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| **Always-on** | `ant beta:worker poll` | Continuous polling; simplest setup |
| **Always-on** | SDK `EnvironmentWorker.run()` | Python / TypeScript / Go; supports custom tool list |
| **Webhook-triggered** | SDK `EnvironmentWorker.handle_item()` | Wakes on `session.status_run_started`; exits when session ends |
| **Custom per-session container** | SDK `work.poller()` | Claim each session and launch your own container |

**SDK dependency requirements:** `/bin/bash` must exist at that exact path.
TypeScript SDK additionally requires `unzip`, `tar`, and Node.js 22+.

**Monitoring (call from operations tooling with org API key, not env key):**

| Call | What it returns |
|---|---|
| `work.stats` | `depth` (queued), `pending` (in-flight), `oldest_queued_at`, `workers_polling` |
| `work.stop` | Graceful shutdown; `force: true` interrupts immediately |

**Limitations at launch:**
- Memory stores not supported with self-hosted sandboxes.
- Not available on Claude Platform on AWS.

**Security:** Anthropic owns control-plane security (session integrity,
multi-tenant isolation). You own: container image hardening, network egress
controls, environment key storage and rotation, tool-execution blast radius,
and log/data retention. See the security page for the full shared-responsibility model.

# Platform — Managed Agents

> *Router lives in [`SKILL.md`](SKILL.md). For the Agent SDK
> (build your own agents locally with TS/Python), see
> [`claude-agent-sdk`](../claude-agent-sdk/SKILL.md). Managed Agents
> is the *hosted* alternative — Anthropic runs the agent infrastructure.*

## Key facts (at intent time)

- **Managed Agents vs Agent SDK:** the SDK is a library you embed in
  your app (you run the loop). Managed Agents is a hosted product
  (Anthropic runs the loop, your agent definition lives on Anthropic
  infrastructure). Decision: SDK for tight integration with your
  service; Managed Agents for fire-and-forget jobs and the Dreams
  long-running pattern.
- **Also available on Claude Platform on AWS.** Managed Agents runs on
  AWS-hosted Claude infrastructure with some differences in feature
  availability and session behavior. See
  [`claude-platform-on-aws.md`](https://platform.claude.com/docs/en/build-with-claude/claude-platform-on-aws.md).
- **Endpoint rate limits (org-level):** Create endpoints (agents,
  sessions, environments, etc.) — 300 RPM. Read endpoints (retrieve,
  list, stream, etc.) — 600 RPM. Org-level spend limits and tier-based
  rate limits also apply.
- **Dreams = long-running.** A Dream is an agent execution that can
  run for hours or days, surviving across sessions. Use for research
  syntheses, batch processing, multi-step workflows that don't fit
  in a single conversation.
- **Sessions are persistent conversations.** Unlike Messages API
  (stateless), a Managed Agent session holds state across calls.
  Bill by tokens consumed, not by session duration.
- **Vaults** store secrets your agent needs to access third-party
  services (API keys, OAuth tokens). Encrypted at rest, scoped per
  agent, never exposed to your agent's prompt context.
- **Permission policies** gate what each agent may do (which tools,
  which file paths, which network endpoints). Set on the agent
  definition; enforced server-side. Default-deny.
- **Cloud containers** are the execution sandbox for code-running
  agents. Limited CPU / memory / network egress. Configure per agent
  via the environments resource.
- **Beta API surface.** All Managed-Agents endpoints currently live
  under `/v1/...` with the `anthropic-beta` header
  (`managed-agents-2026-04-01`). Pin the beta string to a specific
  version; the shape may evolve.
- **Memory stores persist cross-session.** A memory store
  (`memstore_...` ID) is a workspace-scoped collection of text
  documents mounted as a directory in the agent's container. Create
  via `POST /v1/memory_stores`, seed with
  `POST /v1/memory_stores/{id}/memories`, attach when starting a
  session. Every write creates an immutable version (audit trail).
  Requires the agent toolset to be enabled for read/write operations.
- **Webhooks for async results.** Long-running Dreams notify
  completion via webhook (configure per agent). Don't poll — the
  webhook is cheaper and faster.

### Self-hosted sandboxes

By default, Managed Agents runs tools inside Anthropic-managed cloud containers.
Self-hosted sandboxes keep orchestration on Anthropic's side but move **tool
execution** into infrastructure you control — the agent's code, filesystem, and
network egress never leave your environment.

> **Not available on Claude Platform on AWS.**

**When to self-host:**
- Agent must operate on data that cannot leave your network boundary.
- Agent needs to reach internal services that are not publicly routable.
- Your organization requires its own compliance and audit controls over execution.

**Comparison:**

| | Cloud environment | Self-hosted sandbox |
|---|---|---|
| Where tools run | Anthropic-managed containers | Your infrastructure |
| Network reach | Anthropic's egress controls | Your network policy |
| File / GitHub repo mounting | Managed by Anthropic | Managed by you |
| Lifecycle | Managed by Anthropic | Managed by you |

**Combining with MCP tunnels:** Self-hosting controls *where the agent's code
executes*; [MCP tunnels](https://platform.claude.com/docs/en/agents-and-tools/mcp-tunnels/overview.md)
controls *how Anthropic reaches MCP servers in your network*. They are
independent and can be combined.

**Environment worker** — a process on your infrastructure that receives tool
execution requests from Anthropic and runs them locally. Create a
`self_hosted` environment (`config: {"type": "self_hosted"}`), then run a
worker:

| Pattern | How |
|---|---|
| Always-on (CLI) | `ant beta:worker poll --workdir /workspace` |
| Always-on (SDK) | `EnvironmentWorker(...).run()` — Python, TypeScript, Go |
| Webhook-triggered (SDK) | Handle `session.status_run_started`; call `work.poller()` once, then exit |

The worker claims sessions from the environment's work queue, downloads the
agent's skills to `/workspace/skills/<name>/`, executes tool calls, and posts
results back. Use `--on-work <script>` (CLI) or the `work.poller()` helper
(SDK) to launch a **fresh container per session** for stronger isolation.

**Filesystem conventions:**
- `/workspace` — default working directory; skills downloaded here.
- `/mnt/session/outputs` — agent writes final output files here; mount a host directory to retrieve them.

**Auth:** Workers authenticate with an **environment key** (`ANTHROPIC_ENVIRONMENT_KEY`),
not your org API key. Keep the env key out of images and files — store in a
secrets manager and rotate immediately if compromised.

**Queue monitoring** (`work.stats`):

| Field | Meaning |
|---|---|
| `depth` | Sessions waiting to be claimed |
| `pending` | Sessions currently being processed |
| `oldest_queued_at` | Timestamp of oldest queued item |
| `workers_polling` | Workers that have polled in the last 30 s |

**Security responsibilities (self-hosted):** Container image hardening,
network egress controls, env-key storage and rotation, isolating untrusted
workloads, tool-execution blast radius, and log/data retention — all fall to
your organization. Anthropic secures session/work-queue integrity and
multi-tenant isolation at the control plane.

> **Memory** is not yet supported with self-hosted sandboxes.

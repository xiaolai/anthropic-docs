# Platform — Managed Agents

> *Router lives in [`SKILL.md`](SKILL.md). For the Agent SDK
> (build your own agents locally with TS/Python), see
> [`claude-agent-sdk`](../claude-agent-sdk/SKILL.md). Managed Agents
> is the *hosted* alternative — Anthropic runs the agent infrastructure.*

## Key facts (at intent time)

- **Managed Agents vs Agent SDK:** the SDK is a library you embed in
  your app (you run the loop). Managed Agents is a hosted product
  (Anthropic runs the loop, your agent definition lives on Anthropic
  infrastructure). Decision: SDK for tight integration with your
  service; Managed Agents for fire-and-forget jobs and the Dreams
  long-running pattern.
- **Also available on Claude Platform on AWS.** Managed Agents runs on
  AWS-hosted Claude infrastructure with some differences in feature
  availability and session behavior. See
  [`claude-platform-on-aws.md`](https://platform.claude.com/docs/en/build-with-claude/claude-platform-on-aws.md).
- **Endpoint rate limits (org-level):** Create endpoints (agents,
  sessions, environments, etc.) — 300 RPM. Read endpoints (retrieve,
  list, stream, etc.) — 600 RPM. Org-level spend limits and tier-based
  rate limits also apply.
- **Dreams = long-running.** A Dream is an agent execution that can
  run for hours or days, surviving across sessions. Use for research
  syntheses, batch processing, multi-step workflows that don't fit
  in a single conversation.
- **Sessions are persistent conversations.** Unlike Messages API
  (stateless), a Managed Agent session holds state across calls.
  Bill by tokens consumed, not by session duration.
- **Vaults** store secrets your agent needs to access third-party
  services (API keys, OAuth tokens). Encrypted at rest, scoped per
  agent, never exposed to your agent's prompt context.
- **Permission policies** gate what each agent may do (which tools,
  which file paths, which network endpoints). Set on the agent
  definition; enforced server-side. Default-deny.
- **Cloud containers** are the execution sandbox for code-running
  agents. Limited CPU / memory / network egress. Configure per agent
  via the environments resource.
- **Beta API surface.** All Managed-Agents endpoints currently live
  under `/v1/...` with the `anthropic-beta` header
  (`managed-agents-2026-04-01`). Pin the beta string to a specific
  version; the shape may evolve.
- **Memory stores persist cross-session.** A memory store
  (`memstore_...` ID) is a workspace-scoped collection of text
  documents mounted as a directory in the agent's container. Create
  via `POST /v1/memory_stores`, seed with
  `POST /v1/memory_stores/{id}/memories`, attach when starting a
  session. Every write creates an immutable version (audit trail).
  Requires the agent toolset to be enabled for read/write operations.
- **Webhooks for async results.** Long-running Dreams notify
  completion via webhook (configure per agent). Don't poll — the
  webhook is cheaper and faster.

## Self-hosted sandboxes

Run agent tool execution in **your own infrastructure** — Anthropic orchestrates the session but the agent's code, filesystem, and network egress never leave your environment. Not yet available on Claude Platform on AWS.

| | Cloud environment | Self-hosted sandbox |
|---|---|---|
| Where tools run | Anthropic-managed containers | Your infrastructure |
| Network reach | Anthropic's egress controls | Your network policy |
| File / GitHub mounting | Managed by Anthropic | Managed by you |
| Lifecycle | Managed by Anthropic | Managed by you |

Good fit when: data cannot leave your network, the agent needs to reach private services, or your org's compliance controls require it.

### Combine with MCP tunnels

Self-hosting controls *where the agent's code executes*. [MCP tunnels](https://platform.claude.com/docs/en/agents-and-tools/mcp-tunnels/overview.md) control *how Anthropic reaches MCP servers in your network*. They are independent — a cloud-container session can use tunneled MCP servers, and a self-hosted session can use tunneled or public MCP servers.

### Environment worker

An **environment worker** is a process you run that:

1. Polls the environment's **work queue** for sessions assigned to the environment
2. Downloads the agent's skills to `/workspace/skills/<name>/`
3. Executes tool calls locally
4. Posts results back to Anthropic

Two worker architectures:

| Architecture | Supported by | When to use |
|---|---|---|
| **Always-on** | `ant` CLI + SDK | Continuous polling; exit on SIGTERM; simplest setup |
| **Webhook-triggered** | SDK only | Wakes on `session.status_run_started`; good for on-demand / ephemeral hosts |

Pre-built workers: `EnvironmentWorker` (SDK) or `ant beta:worker poll` (CLI). Both manage polling, skill download, and execution end-to-end. For per-session container isolation, use `work.poller()` (SDK) or `--on-work <spawn-script>` (CLI) to launch a fresh container per claimed session.

### Key paths in the sandbox

| Path | Purpose |
|---|---|
| `/workspace` | Default working directory; skills land at `/workspace/skills/<name>/` |
| `/mnt/session/outputs` | Agent writes final output files here; mount a host directory to retrieve them |

> **SDK dependencies:** the SDK helpers require `/bin/bash` at that exact path. The TypeScript SDK additionally requires `unzip`, `tar`, and Node.js 22+.

### Environment key

The **environment key** (`sk-ant-oat01-...`) authenticates the worker to poll the work queue and submit results. It is **scoped to one environment**. Store it in a secrets manager; never bake it into images or env files. Rotate immediately if exposed.

> Never set `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY` on the worker host — that is an org-scoped credential. Use `ANTHROPIC_ENVIRONMENT_KEY` inside the worker.

### Monitoring queue depth and stopping sessions

`work.stats` returns: `depth` (waiting), `pending` (in-progress), `oldest_queued_at`, `workers_polling` (active in last 30 s). Scale or alert based on `depth`.

`work.stop` gracefully stops a session (finishes the current tool call then exits); pass `force: true` to interrupt immediately. These calls authenticate with the **org API key**, not the environment key — run them from outside the worker host.

### Memory limitation

Memory stores are **not yet supported** with self-hosted sandboxes.

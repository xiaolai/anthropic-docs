  Deep reference for the Managed Agents product — Anthropic-hosted
  long-running agents (Dreams) with their own environments, sessions,
  files, memory, vaults, tools, MCP connectors, multi-agent
  coordination, webhooks, GitHub integration, permission policies,
  and event streaming. Covers onboarding through to production
  deployment with cloud containers.

# Platform — Managed Agents

> *Router lives in [`SKILL.md`](SKILL.md). For the Agent SDK
> (build your own agents locally with TS/Python), see
> [`claude-agent-sdk`](../claude-agent-sdk/SKILL.md). Managed Agents
> is the *hosted* alternative — Anthropic runs the agent infrastructure.*

## Key facts (at intent time)

- **Managed Agents vs Agent SDK:** the SDK is a library you embed in
  your app (you run the loop). Managed Agents is a hosted product
  (Anthropic runs the loop, your agent definition lives on Anthropic
  infrastructure). Decision: SDK for tight integration with your
  service; Managed Agents for fire-and-forget jobs and the Dreams
  long-running pattern.
- **Dreams = long-running.** A Dream is an agent execution that can
  run for hours or days, surviving across sessions. Use for research
  syntheses, batch processing, multi-step workflows that don't fit
  in a single conversation.
- **Sessions are persistent conversations.** Unlike Messages API
  (stateless), a Managed Agent session holds state across calls.
  Bill by tokens consumed, not by session duration.
- **Vaults** store secrets your agent needs to access third-party
  services (API keys, OAuth tokens). Encrypted at rest, scoped per
  agent, never exposed to your agent's prompt context.
- **Permission policies** gate what each agent may do (which tools,
  which file paths, which network endpoints). Set on the agent
  definition; enforced server-side. Default-deny.
- **Cloud containers** are the execution sandbox for code-running
  agents. Limited CPU / memory / network egress. Configure per agent
  via the environments resource.
- **Beta API surface.** All Managed-Agents endpoints require
  `anthropic-beta: managed-agents-2026-04-01`. The Anthropic SDK sets
  this header automatically; set it manually with raw HTTP. Pin to a
  specific beta string version; the shape may evolve.
- **Rate limits.** Create endpoints (agents, sessions, environments, etc.)
  are rate-limited at **300 requests per minute** per organization.
- **Some features need extra access.** Outcomes and multiagent
  coordination are in beta (research preview) — request access at
  `claude.com/form/claude-managed-agents`.
- **Webhooks for async results.** Long-running Dreams notify
  completion via webhook (configure per agent). Don't poll — the
  webhook is cheaper and faster.

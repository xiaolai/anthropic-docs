# Workload Identity Federation

Authenticate workloads to the Claude API with short-lived identity tokens from your own identity provider instead of long-lived static API keys.

---

Workload Identity Federation (WIF) lets your workloads authenticate to the Claude API using short-lived OpenID Connect (OIDC) tokens issued by an identity provider (IdP) you already operate, such as AWS IAM, Google Cloud, or any standards-compliant OIDC issuer (such as GitHub Actions, Kubernetes service accounts, SPIFFE, Microsoft Entra ID, or Okta), instead of long-lived `sk-ant-...` API keys.

Your workload presents a signed JWT from your identity provider. Anthropic validates it against trust rules you configure in the Claude Console and returns a short-lived Anthropic access token bound to a service account in your organization. There are no static secrets to mint, store in CI, rotate, or leak.

Workload Identity Federation strengthens your security posture by removing static credentials from Anthropic's surface and replacing them with tokens that expire in minutes rather than never. It is not a complete security story on its own: federated authentication is only as strong as the upstream identity provider that signs the JWT. Pair Workload Identity Federation with the controls your IdP already supports (workload identity binding, conditional access, audit logging) for defense in depth.

## How it works

1. **Your IdP issues a JWT to the workload.** On most platforms this is ambient: a Kubernetes projected service-account token, the Google Cloud metadata server, Azure IMDS, or the GitHub Actions OIDC endpoint. The JWT's `iss` claim identifies the provider, and its `sub` and other claims identify the specific workload.
2. **The SDK exchanges the JWT for an Anthropic access token.** Given the federation environment variables (or a profile) and the JWT (typically read from a file), the SDK posts the JWT to `POST /v1/oauth/token` using the [RFC 7523](https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc7523) `jwt-bearer` grant. Anthropic verifies the signature against the JWKS you registered for the issuer, checks the standard `exp`/`nbf`/`iat` claims, and matches the JWT's claims against the federation rule you specify. The response is a standard OAuth 2.0 token response (`access_token`, `token_type`, `expires_in`, `scope`) with a short-lived `sk-ant-oat01-...` token that acts on behalf of the service account targeted by the matched rule.
3. **The SDK sends the token on every request and refreshes it before it expires.** Your application code constructs the client with no `api_key` and calls the API as usual. The SDK re-runs the exchange before the token expires.

## Concepts

You configure three resources in the Claude Console before any workload can federate. Together they express "tokens signed by issuer X, with claims that look like Y, may act as service account Z."

### Service accounts

A **service account** (`svac_...`) is a named, non-human identity inside your Anthropic organization. It is the principal that a federated token acts as. Service accounts live at the organization level and become active in a workspace when you add them to that workspace's members. At exchange time, Anthropic checks that the federation rule's workspace matches one of the service account's workspace memberships; the minted token then follows that workspace's rate limits and usage attribution, the same as an API key. Unlike a human user, a service account has no email, no password, and no Console login.

The key distinction from an API key: an API key *is* a credential, while a service account *has* credentials minted for it on demand. You can audit which workloads acted as which service account.

### Federation issuers

A **federation issuer** (`fdis_...`) registers an OIDC identity provider with your organization. Registering an issuer tells Anthropic "JWTs signed by this provider may assert workload identity for my org."

An issuer has two pieces of configuration:

- **Issuer URL:** The exact `iss` claim value that appears in the provider's JWTs, for example `https://token.actions.githubusercontent.com` or `https://oidc.eks.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/id/EXAMPLE`.
- **JWKS source:** How Anthropic fetches the public keys to verify JWT signatures. Use `discovery` (the default) for any provider that serves `/.well-known/openid-configuration` at its issuer URL. Use `explicit_url` to point at a JWKS endpoint directly, or `inline` to upload the key set for issuers that are not reachable from the public internet (for example, a private Kubernetes cluster).

Issuer and JWKS URLs must be `https`, on port 443, and use a public DNS host name that resolves to public IP addresses; IP literals are not accepted. These constraints apply only to URLs Anthropic fetches; in `explicit_url` and `inline` modes the `issuer_url` is compared as a string and may reference an internal hostname.

You typically register one issuer per environment: your production EKS cluster, your staging cluster, and GitHub Actions are three separate issuers.

### Federation rules

A **federation rule** (`fdrl_...`) is the bridge between an issuer and a service account: "when a JWT from issuer X has claims that look like Y, mint a token for service account Z with scope S."

A rule defines match conditions, a target, and the authorization scope and token lifetime that apply when the rule matches:

- **Match:** The conditions an incoming JWT must satisfy. You can match on a `subject_prefix` (for example, `system:serviceaccount:prod:worker`, or with a trailing `*` for a prefix match), an exact `audience`, a map of exact claim values, a [CEL](https://cel.dev/) `condition` expression for complex logic, or any combination. At least one of `subject_prefix`, `claims`, or `condition` must be set, and all configured matchers must pass for the JWT to be accepted.
- **Target:** The service account the matched JWT maps to.
- **Authorization:** The OAuth `scope` granted on the minted token. At launch this is always `workspace:developer`, which grants the same access as an API key issued for that workspace (see [OAuth scopes](/docs/en/manage-claude/wif-reference#oauth-scopes)). The rule also sets `token_lifetime_seconds` (60 to 86400, default 3600).

A single issuer can have many rules: one per team, namespace, or permission level. Rules are evaluated by ID: the client specifies which rule to use in the exchange request, and Anthropic verifies the JWT satisfies that rule's match criteria. There is no implicit rule search.

## Set up federation

You need admin access to your Anthropic organization, an OIDC-capable identity provider with a reachable JWKS endpoint (or a JWKS document you can paste, for air-gapped clusters), and a workload that can obtain an identity token from that provider.

In the Claude Console, go to **Settings → Workload identity**.

<Steps>
  <Step title="Register an issuer">
    On the **Issuers** tab, select **Create issuer**.

    | Field | Value |
    | --- | --- |
    | Name | A label for your reference, such as `prod-eks` or `gha`. Lowercase letters, digits, and hyphens. |
    | Issuer URL | The exact `iss` claim your IdP puts in its JWTs. If you are unsure, decode a sample token: <code>jq -rR 'split(".")[1] \| gsub("-";"+") \| gsub("_";"/") \| @base64d \| fromjson \| .iss' token</code> |
    | JWKS source | `discovery` for most managed IdPs. Choose `explicit_url` or `inline` only if discovery is not available. |
    | Discovery base / JWKS URL / Inline keys | Mode-specific. Leave blank for discovery when the IdP serves `.well-known` at the issuer URL. |
    | CA cert PEM | Only if your IdP serves TLS from a private CA. Most managed IdPs use public CAs, so leave this blank. |

    The Console includes presets for AWS and Google Cloud that pre-fill the issuer URL pattern and a sensible default rule, plus a generic OIDC option for any other standards-compliant provider (such as GitHub Actions, Kubernetes service-account issuers, Microsoft Entra ID, or Okta).
  </Step>

  <Step title="Create a service account">
    Go to **Settings → Service accounts → Create service account**. Provide a name (for example, `inference-worker` or `ci-deploy`) and an optional description.

    This is the identity your minted tokens act as. Add the service account to each workspace it should act in from that workspace's **Members** page. The federation rule in the next step targets one workspace, and the minted token is scoped to that workspace's rate limits and usage attribution. Note the service account ID (`svac_...`).
  </Step>

  <Step title="Create a federation rule">
    Back on the **Workload identity** page, open the **Federation rules** tab and select **Create rule**.

    | Section | Value |
    | --- | --- |
    | Basic info | A name and optional description. Select the issuer you registered in step 1. |
    | Match | Choose **Static** for subject prefix, audience, and exact-claim matching, or **CEL** for an expression. Be as specific as your IdP's claims allow: a rule that matches too broadly grants more access than you intend. |
    | Target | Select the service account you created in step 2. |
    | Authorization | OAuth scope (`workspace:developer` at launch; see [OAuth scopes](/docs/en/manage-claude/wif-reference#oauth-scopes)) and token lifetime in seconds. |

    Note the rule's ID (`fdrl_...`). Your workload passes this ID in every token-exchange request.
  </Step>
</Steps>

## Authenticate from your workload

With federation configured, your workload exchanges its IdP-issued JWT for an Anthropic token at runtime. The SDKs handle the exchange and refresh loop for you. The cURL tab shows the underlying HTTP exchange for shell scripts, debugging, or languages without SDK support.

### Construct the SDK client

You can construct the client with explicit credentials or with no arguments. With no arguments, the SDK resolves credentials from environment variables or the active profile, as described under [Credential precedence](#credential-precedence). The zero-argument form is the recommended pattern for production workloads: ship the same container image everywhere and inject `ANTHROPIC_FEDERATION_RULE_ID`, `ANTHROPIC_ORGANIZATION_ID`, `ANTHROPIC_SERVICE_ACCOUNT_ID`, `ANTHROPIC_WORKSPACE_ID`, and `ANTHROPIC_IDENTITY_TOKEN_FILE` per environment.

The token-exchange response follows [RFC 6749 §5.1](https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc6749#section-5.1). See [Token exchange response](/docs/en/manage-claude/wif-reference#token-exchange-response) for the field reference.

## Credential precedence

Every SDK resolves credentials in the same five-tier order: constructor arguments, then `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY` / `ANTHROPIC_AUTH_TOKEN`, then an explicit `ANTHROPIC_PROFILE`, then the federation environment variables, then the implicit active profile. The first source that yields a credential wins.

<Warning>
  `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY` sits above the federation tiers, so a leftover key in the
  environment silently shadows federation. When migrating a workload from API
  keys to Workload Identity Federation, confirm `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY` is unset everywhere that workload
  runs (container env, CI secrets, shell profiles). The CLI's [`ant auth status`](/docs/en/api/sdks/cli#check-authentication-status)
  command reports which source won.
</Warning>

For the full precedence table, the per-tier semantics, and the profile file schema, see [Credential precedence](/docs/en/manage-claude/wif-reference#credential-precedence) in the WIF reference.

## Migrate from API keys

To switch an existing workload from a static API key to federation without downtime:

1. **Configure federation in parallel.** Complete the [setup walkthrough](#set-up-federation) and confirm the federation rule matches your workload's token. Leave the existing `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY` in place for now.
2. **Smoke-test which credential wins.** Run `ant auth status` from inside the workload (or inspect SDK debug logs). Because `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY` sits above the federation tiers in the precedence chain, the API key still wins at this stage.
3. **Unset `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY` everywhere it is injected.** Remove it from CI secrets, container environment, and shell profiles (see the preceding warning). Re-run `ant auth status` and confirm the federation source is now selected.
4. **Revoke the API key.** Once the workload is running on the federated token, delete the key in the Claude Console under **Settings → API keys**.

## Token lifetime and refresh

The minted Anthropic token's lifetime is the lesser of the rule's `token_lifetime_seconds` (default 3600 seconds) and twice the remaining lifetime of the IdP JWT you presented, with a 60-second floor. The second bound prevents an Anthropic token from outliving the upstream identity it was derived from by more than a small margin.

The SDKs cache the token and refresh it on a two-tier schedule modeled on `botocore`:

- **Advisory refresh** at expiry minus 120 seconds. The SDK attempts a new exchange. If the token endpoint is unreachable, the SDK continues serving the cached token, which is still valid for roughly 90 more seconds.
- **Mandatory refresh** at expiry minus 30 seconds. A failed exchange at this point raises an error. The cached token is too close to expiry to be safe.

Because the SDK re-reads `ANTHROPIC_IDENTITY_TOKEN_FILE` on every exchange, it transparently picks up rotated projected tokens (Kubernetes service-account tokens, for example, rotate well before their `exp`).

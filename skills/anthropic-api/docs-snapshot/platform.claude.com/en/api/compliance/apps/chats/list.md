## List

**get** `/v1/compliance/apps/chats`

Lists chat metadata with filtering capabilities for targeted
compliance review. Results are sorted chronologically (time ascending)
by created_at, with ties broken by id.

### Query Parameters

  Pagination cursor for retrieving the next page of results (heading backwards in time). To paginate, pass the `last_id` value from the most recent response. Clients should treat this value as an opaque string and not attempt to parse or interpret its contents, as the format may change without notice.

- `before_id: optional string`

  Pagination cursor for retrieving the previous page of results (heading forwards in time). To paginate, pass the `first_id` value from the most recent response. Clients should treat this value as an opaque string and not attempt to parse or interpret its contents, as the format may change without notice.

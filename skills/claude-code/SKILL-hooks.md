  Deep reference for Claude Code's hook system. Covers every hook
  event (PreToolUse, PostToolUse, Stop, SubagentStop, Notification,
  UserPromptSubmit, PreCompact, SessionStart, SessionEnd), the input
  JSON shape each event delivers to your hook command, the output JSON
  shape the hook can return to influence Claude's behavior, matcher
  syntax, blocking vs non-blocking semantics, and authoring patterns.
  Read this file when the user asks about hook events, hook scripts,
  hook matchers, blocking tool calls, or hook debugging.

# Claude Code — Hooks

> *This file is one of seven surface-specific references. The router
> ([`SKILL.md`](SKILL.md)) dispatches you here for hook questions.*

## Hook event catalog

> *Populated by the research agent.*
> Source: `code.claude.com/docs/en/hooks.md`,
> `code.claude.com/docs/en/hooks-guide.md`.

## Configuration: where hooks live

> *Populated by the research agent.* Hooks are declared in
> `settings.json` under the `hooks` key. Cross-reference:
> [`SKILL-settings.md`](SKILL-settings.md) `hooks` block.

## Matcher syntax

> *Populated by the research agent.* Covers tool-name matchers,
> regex matchers, and the `*` wildcard.

## Hook input shape

<!-- seed: replace on first real research pass -->

Claude Code writes a single JSON object to your hook's stdin. Common top-level fields:

| Field | Type | Always present? | Notes |
|---|---|---|---|
| `hook_event_name` | string | yes | One of: `PreToolUse`, `PostToolUse`, `Stop`, `SubagentStop`, `Notification`, `UserPromptSubmit`, `PreCompact`, `SessionStart`, `SessionEnd` |
| `session_id` | string | yes | Stable id for the current Claude Code session |
| `transcript_path` | string | yes (absent only when the session runs without persistent transcript, e.g. headless and SDK contexts that run without a persistent transcript file) | Path to the rolling conversation transcript |
| `cwd` | string | yes (absent only when the session is launched without a working directory, e.g. SDK contexts where the caller passes no cwd) | Working directory the session was launched from |
| `tool_name` | string | PreToolUse / PostToolUse only | e.g. `Bash`, `Read`, `Edit` |
| `tool_input` | object | PreToolUse / PostToolUse only | The arguments the tool is about to receive (or was just called with) |
| `tool_response` | any | PostToolUse only | What the tool returned |
| `prompt` | string | UserPromptSubmit only | The user's just-submitted prompt text |
| `source` | string | SessionStart only | `startup`, `resume`, or `compact` |

Example payload for a `PreToolUse` event on a Bash call:

```json
{
  "hook_event_name": "PreToolUse",
  "session_id": "01J9...XYZ",
  "transcript_path": "/tmp/claude/transcripts/01J9.jsonl",
  "cwd": "/Users/me/projects/demo",
  "tool_name": "Bash",
  "tool_input": {
    "command": "git status",
    "description": "Show working tree status"
  }
}
```

## Hook output shape

> *Populated by the research agent.* The JSON your hook can write to
> stdout to influence Claude (block tool call, modify input, suppress
> output, etc.).

## Blocking vs non-blocking

> *Populated by the research agent.*

## Worked examples

> *Populated by the research agent.* Concrete hook scripts for common
> use cases. See also: [`templates/hooks/`](templates/hooks/).

## Common mistakes (auto-corrected by `rules/hooks.md`)

> *Populated by the research agent.*

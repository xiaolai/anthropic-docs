  Deep reference for configuring MCP (Model Context Protocol) servers
  in Claude Code. Covers `.mcp.json` schema, the three transports
  (stdio / http / sse), server config keys (command, args, url, env,
  headers, capabilities), the `mcp__<server>__<tool>` naming
  convention for invoking MCP tools, scope (project / user), and
  troubleshooting. Read this file when the user asks about MCP setup,
  `.mcp.json`, MCP transports, or MCP tool naming.

# Claude Code — MCP server config (`.mcp.json`)

> *This file is one of seven surface-specific references. The router
> ([`SKILL.md`](SKILL.md)) dispatches you here for MCP questions.*

## File scope

> *Populated by the research agent.* Project `.mcp.json` vs user-level
> MCP config.

## Top-level shape

<!-- seed: replace on first real research pass -->

`.mcp.json` has a single top-level key, `mcpServers`, whose value is an object mapping a server name to its config. The server name is what surfaces in tool names (`mcp__<server>__<tool>`).

Minimal example — one stdio server (with an exact version pin, recommended):

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "filesystem": {
      "command": "npx",
      "args": ["-y", "@modelcontextprotocol/server-filesystem@0.6.2", "/Users/me/projects"]
    }
  }
}
```

The `command` field implies stdio transport (the default). For remote transports, add `"type": "http"` or `"type": "sse"` plus a `url` field whose value is the transport endpoint. See § *Transport: `http`* and § *Transport: `sse`* below for full per-transport schemas, including auth headers and capability declarations.

**Pin your MCP server versions.** The bare `npx -y @scope/server` pattern (no version pin) resolves to the latest version on every startup — a supply-chain compromise of any future release runs immediately with whatever capabilities the server requests. MCP servers commonly request filesystem or network capabilities, so this is a real blast radius. See [`templates/MCP-PINNING.md`](templates/MCP-PINNING.md) for the rationale and the canonical pattern.

## Transport: `stdio`

> *Populated by the research agent.* Local subprocess transport.

## Transport: `http`

> *Populated by the research agent.* Remote HTTP transport, headers,

## Transport: `sse`

> *Populated by the research agent.* Server-Sent Events transport.

## Tool naming convention

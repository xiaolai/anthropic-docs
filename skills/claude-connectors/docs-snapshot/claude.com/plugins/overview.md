# Plugins overview

> Extend Claude with reusable capability packages that bundle MCP connectors, skills, slash commands, and sub-agents

Plugins are reusable capability packages that extend Claude with custom functionality. They bundle together [MCP connectors](/connectors/overview), [skills](/skills/overview), slash commands, and sub-agents into a single shareable unit — turning Claude into a specialist tailored to your role, team, and company.

## What plugins do

Plugins let you define how you like work done, which tools and data to pull from, how to handle critical workflows, and what slash commands to expose so your team gets consistent outcomes. Every component is file-based, so plugins are easy to build, edit, and share.

As your team builds and shares plugins, Claude becomes a cross-functional expert. Best practices get baked into every interaction, so leaders and admins can spend less time enforcing processes and more time improving them.

## Plugin directory

To help you get started, Anthropic has open-sourced 11 plugins built and used internally:

## Origins in Claude Code

Plugins originated in [Claude Code](https://code.claude.com/docs/en/plugins), where developers create and distribute them as versioned, shareable directories. A Claude Code plugin lives in a directory with a manifest (`plugin.json`) that defines its identity, version, and available components.

<Note>
  For technical details on plugin structure, manifests, and configuration, see the [Claude Code plugins reference](https://code.claude.com/docs/en/plugins-reference).

## Plugins in Cowork

Plugins are fully supported in [Cowork](https://support.claude.com/en/articles/13345190-getting-started-with-cowork), Anthropic's agentic workspace for complex, multi-step knowledge work. In Cowork, Claude runs inside an isolated virtual machine environment, executes tasks in parallel workstreams, and writes outputs directly to your file system — and plugins extend all of that capability.

A sales plugin, for example, could connect Claude to your CRM and knowledge base, teach it your sales process, and give you slash commands for everything from prospect research to call follow-ups. You define what goes in the plugin once, and Claude pulls from that context whenever it's relevant.

## How plugins compose capabilities

| Plugin component   | What it adds                                                      | Example                                                                         |
| ------------------ | ----------------------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Skills**         | Specialized instructions Claude follows when relevant tasks arise | A "brand voice" skill that activates when drafting external communications      |
| **MCP connectors** | Access to external tools and data                                 | A connector to a CRM that lets Claude read and update deal records              |
| **Slash commands** | Explicit, user-triggered workflows                                | `/sales:prospect-research` to kick off a structured research workflow           |
| **Sub-agents**     | Delegated workstreams that run in parallel                        | A sub-agent that handles competitive analysis while another drafts the proposal |

## Availability

Plugin support in Cowork is available as a research preview for all paid Claude users. Plugins are currently saved locally to your machine. Org-wide sharing and management are coming in the weeks ahead.

  Available on Pro, Max, Team, and Enterprise plans. All Claude integrations are currently in beta.
</Note>

## How to use Gmail integration

### 1. Ask a question

Simply ask Claude a question that needs email information. Claude automatically detects when email data is needed.

**Example questions:**

* "What did Sarah say about the project deadline?"
* "Find emails about the Q4 budget review"
* "Summarize my conversation with the sales team last week"

### 2. Review Claude's response

Claude provides answers that include:

* Clear answers to your questions
* Citations indicating which emails were used
* Links to original sources when applicable

### 3. Follow up

You can ask for more details, such as:

* Requesting additional email information
* Finding related threads
* Summarizing longer conversations

## Understanding citations

Citations show which specific emails Claude used to answer your question. You can follow links back to original sources for verification and additional context.

## Privacy and data handling

### Authentication

You must authenticate directly to your Google account. For Claude for Work (Team/Enterprise) plans, an Owner or Primary Owner must enable integrations at the account level.

### Data access

* Claude accesses only data from your connected Google account
* Access occurs only when you explicitly request it
* Minimum information is retrieved to answer your question
* Your existing Gmail permissions are mirrored

## Limitations

<Warning>
  * Claude cannot create, send, or modify emails
  * Embedded images in emails are not visible to Claude
  * Only emails you have access to can be searched
</Warning>

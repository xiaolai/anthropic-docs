## What are desktop extensions?

Desktop extensions are local MCP servers that run on user devices, providing:

* Local tool access without internet dependency
* Enhanced security for sensitive operations
* Custom integrations for internal tools
* Enterprise deployment capabilities

## MCPB (MCP Bundles)

MCPB is Anthropic's utility for building and deploying desktop extensions:

* Package MCP servers for distribution
* Handle cross-platform compatibility
* Manage dependencies
* Support enterprise deployment

### Key features

* **Bundling**: Package your MCP server with all dependencies
* **Distribution**: Deploy to users via your organization's channels
* **Updates**: Manage version updates centrally
* **Security**: Sign and verify extensions

## When to use desktop vs remote

| Use Case                    | Recommended       |
| --------------------------- | ----------------- |
| Access to local files/tools | Desktop Extension |
| Internet-hosted services    | Remote MCP        |
| Sensitive enterprise data   | Desktop Extension |
| Public APIs                 | Remote MCP        |
| Offline capability needed   | Desktop Extension |

## Enterprise deployment

For Team and Enterprise plans, admins can:

1. Build custom desktop extensions
2. Package with MCPB
3. Deploy through enterprise software management
4. Control which extensions are available to users

## Security considerations

Desktop extensions run locally with user permissions:

* Access only what the user can access
* No data transmitted unless explicitly designed
* Full audit capability for enterprise
* Revocable by administrators

## Getting started

1. Review the [MCPB documentation](https://github.com/modelcontextprotocol/mcpb)
2. Build your MCP server
3. Bundle with MCPB
4. Test locally
5. Deploy to your organization

# Cowork on 3P — MDM Configuration Rules

## Rule 1 — `inferenceProvider` is a fixed enum

Valid values: `vertex`, `bedrock`, `foundry`, `gateway`. Anything else
makes the desktop app fall back to standard Cowork (Anthropic-hosted
inference) — defeating the 3P deployment.

```xml
<key>inferenceProvider</key>
<string>bedrock</string>   <!-- not "Bedrock", not "aws-bedrock" -->
```

## Rule 2 — Region pin required for vertex / bedrock

When `inferenceProvider` is `vertex`, **must** also set
`inferenceVertexRegion`. When `bedrock`, set `inferenceBedrockRegion`.
Without these, the app falls back to a default region (us-east) which
defeats data-residency guarantees.

```xml
<key>inferenceProvider</key>
<string>vertex</string>
<key>inferenceVertexRegion</key>
<string>europe-west4</string>
```

## Rule 3 — Foundry preview caveat

`inferenceProvider: foundry` is a **preview integration** — model
inference still runs on Anthropic infrastructure during the preview.
The "no conversation egress to Anthropic" guarantee does NOT apply.
For HIPAA / data-sovereignty deployments, use Bedrock or Vertex.

If your org's compliance policy requires no Anthropic egress, the
MDM profile should explicitly NOT set `inferenceProvider: foundry`.

## Rule 4 — Telemetry kill switches

Four independent telemetry/update keys (all `false` by default — telemetry enabled):

- `disableEssentialTelemetry`: boolean — crash reports and error telemetry to Anthropic. Disabling opts into manual log support.
- `disableNonessentialTelemetry`: boolean — product-usage analytics to Anthropic.
- `disableNonessentialServices`: boolean — non-critical third-party services (connector favicons, artifact-preview iframe).
- `disableAutoUpdates`: boolean — auto-update checks and downloads from Anthropic.

All four are off-by-default (telemetry enabled). For air-gapped or
compliance-hardened deployments, set all four to `true`.

Telemetry NEVER contains user prompts or completions, but if your
audit posture requires zero Anthropic-bound network traffic, disable
all four.

## Rule 5 — Don't mix per-user and admin profiles

When an admin MDM profile is present, end-user overrides are ignored.
If you ship a user-level config that contradicts the admin profile,
the user-level config is silently dropped — debugging takes hours.

Best practice: admin profile owns infrastructure config
(provider, region, auth); per-user config owns preferences (theme,
shortcuts). Don't let them overlap.

## Rule 6 — M365 connector requires Microsoft Graph admin consent

The `enableM365Connector: true` key alone doesn't install the
connector. Microsoft Graph admin consent must complete first (see
[`3p/connectors-m365.md`](https://claude.com/docs/cowork/3p/connectors-m365.md)).
Without the consent, the connector is visible but every operation
errors with "permissions not granted by an admin."

## Rule 7 — Org-plugins directory: pin versions

The `orgPluginsDirectory` config takes a URL to a marketplace-style
JSON file your org publishes. **Pin plugin versions** in that
manifest; bare references resolve to "latest" and inherit any
breaking change immediately.

## Rule 8 — Token caps are per-device per window, not per-request

`inferenceMaxTokensPerWindow` (integer) caps total input + output tokens per
device per tumbling window defined by `inferenceTokenWindowHours` (1–720 h).
When the cap is hit, new messages are refused locally until the window resets.
Both keys are enforced on-device and persist across restarts.

# Code tab

> How Cowork on 3P configuration applies to the embedded Claude Code engine

The Code tab in Cowork on third-party (3P) is the embedded [Claude Code](https://code.claude.com/docs/en/overview) interface. It runs the same Claude Code engine as the standalone CLI, with a graphical session manager, and it inherits your Cowork on 3P configuration automatically.

## How configuration propagates

When the app starts a Code session, it translates your Cowork on 3P [configuration keys](/cowork/3p/configuration) into the equivalent Claude Code settings and passes them to the session. You configure one profile, and both tabs honor it.

Each key reaches Claude Code through one of two mechanisms, and the distinction matters if you also deploy Claude Code's own managed settings (see [the next section](#interaction-with-claude-codes-own-managed-settings)).

### Always applied

These keys are passed directly to the Claude Code process as environment variables or launch options. They take effect on every Code session and cannot be overridden by user-level Claude Code settings or by a separately deployed `managed-settings.json`.

| `inferenceProvider` and all provider credential keys (`inferenceGateway*`, `inferenceVertex*`, `inferenceBedrock*`, `inferenceFoundry*`, `inferenceCredentialHelper*`) | Selects the inference backend and supplies credentials.

### Applied as managed policy

These keys are translated into Claude Code [managed settings](https://code.claude.com/docs/en/settings#settings-files) and supplied to the session as policy. They take precedence over user and project settings, but they participate in Claude Code's managed-settings precedence if you have also deployed a separate Claude Code policy.

| Cowork on 3P key           | Claude Code policy it produces                                                                                                                                                          |
| -------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `coworkEgressAllowedHosts` | A network sandbox restricted to your hosts plus the inference and telemetry endpoints, `WebFetch` permission rules for the same hosts, and `allowManagedDomainsOnly`.                   |
| `allowedWorkspaceFolders`  | Filesystem sandbox and `Read`/`Edit` permission rules scoped to your allowed roots, plus `additionalDirectories`. The app also refuses to start a Code session outside an allowed root. |
| `managedMcpServers`        | An `allowedMcpServers` list containing only your managed servers, with `allowManagedMcpServersOnly` set so users cannot add their own from Claude Code's side.                          |

## Interaction with Claude Code's own managed settings

Claude Code can also be configured directly by deploying a [`managed-settings.json` file](https://code.claude.com/docs/en/settings#settings-files), an OS configuration profile for Claude Code, or (with Anthropic authentication) server-managed settings. If a device has any of these, Claude Code treats it as the administrator policy and, by default, **ignores** the policy values Cowork supplies from the [Applied as managed policy](#applied-as-managed-policy) table. The [Always applied](#always-applied) keys are unaffected.

To have Cowork's restrictions apply on top of your Claude Code policy, set `parentSettingsBehavior` to `"merge"` in the Claude Code managed settings you deploy:

```json managed-settings.json theme={null}
{
  "parentSettingsBehavior": "merge"
}
```

With `"merge"`, Cowork's policy values are layered under your Claude Code policy. Your values win any conflict, deny and allow lists are unioned, and Cowork's values are filtered so they can only tighten policy, never loosen it. See [`parentSettingsBehavior`](https://code.claude.com/docs/en/settings#available-settings) in the Claude Code settings reference. Requires Claude Code v2.1.133 or later, which ships with Cowork on 3P.

<Note>
  In a third-party deployment there is no Anthropic authentication, so Claude Code's server-managed settings tier is never present. If you have not separately deployed a Claude Code `managed-settings.json` or OS profile, Cowork's policy applies automatically and you do not need to set `parentSettingsBehavior`.

## Disabling the Code tab

To remove the Code tab entirely, set `isClaudeCodeForDesktopEnabled` to `false` in your Cowork on 3P configuration. Users see only the Cowork tab.

# Install financial services plugins for Cowork

> Add the open-source financial services plugin set to Cowork for financial modeling, equity research, investment banking, private equity, and wealth management workflows.

A set of open-source plugins extends Cowork with specialized
capabilities for financial services workflows: financial modeling,
equity research, investment banking, private equity, and wealth
management. The plugins also work in Claude Code.

The plugins live in a
[public GitHub repository](https://github.com/anthropics/financial-services-plugins)
that you can add as a marketplace in Cowork.

## What's included

The repository contains a core plugin and several add-on plugins that
build on it.

| Plugin                    | What it does                                                                                                                                                                |
| ------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Financial analysis (core) | Build comparable company analyses, DCF models, LBO models, and 3-statement financials. Includes all shared MCP connectors for financial data providers. Install this first. |
| Investment banking        | Draft CIMs, teasers, and process letters. Build buyer lists, run merger models, and create strip profiles.                                                                  |
| Equity research           | Write earnings updates and initiating coverage reports. Track catalysts and screen for new ideas.                                                                           |
| Private equity            | Source and screen deals, run due diligence checklists, draft IC memos, and monitor portfolio company KPIs.                                                                  |
| Wealth management         | Prep for client meetings, build financial plans, rebalance portfolios, and identify tax-loss harvesting opportunities.                                                      |

The repository also includes partner-built plugins from LSEG and S\&P
Global, which bring their financial data and analytics directly into
Cowork.

## Customize plugins for your firm

These plugins are starting points. Plugins are file-based Markdown and
JSON, so no code or infrastructure is required to customize them. Edit
the plugin files directly to match your firm's workflows.

* Add your firm's terminology, processes, and formatting standards to
  skill files.
* Swap or add MCP connectors to point at your specific data providers.
* Adjust workflow instructions to reflect how your team does analysis.
* Use `/ppt-template` to teach Claude your firm's branded PowerPoint
  layouts.
